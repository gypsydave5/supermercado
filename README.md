Supermercado
============

Tiring of repeatedly writing the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/gypsydave5/boris-bikes) project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), [Albert](https://github.com/byverdu) and I decided to do the same thing but with a supermarket instead.

####How to use

The model is not hooked up to an interface, so you won't be able to use the model. Unless you write one.

####Testing

The model is tested using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec). Once the repository is cloned, run `bundle` to install the dependencies and `rspec` to run the test suite.
